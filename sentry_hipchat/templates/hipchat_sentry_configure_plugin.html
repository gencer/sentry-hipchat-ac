<p>
  Hipchat notifications are managed through Hipchat itself.  After you
  added the Sentry integration directly into Hipchat you can add projects
  directly from there to your rooms.
<p>
  This page only shows in which rooms the project shows up.  To add or
  remove them, you need to use the integration configuration page.
{% if on_premise %}
<p>
  To add the Sentry integration to Hipchat click on “Install an integration
  from a descriptor URL” on your room in Hipchat and add the following
  descriptor URL:
<pre>{{ descriptor }}</pre>
{% endif %}
<h2>Active Rooms</h2>
{% if not tenants %}
<p>The plugin is currently not active in any rooms.
{% else %}
  <ul>
    {% for tenant in tenants %}
      <li><dl>
        <dt>Hipchat instance:
        <dd>{{ tenant.installed_from }}
        <dt>Room:
        <dd>{{ tenant.room_name }} (id: {{ tenant.room_id }}; owner: {{ tenant.room_owner_name }})
        <dt>Authenticated user:
        <dd>{{ tenant.auth_user.username }}
      </dl>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can add or remove rooms directly from within Hipchat.  If you
    disable the plugin here, all associations are automatically deleted
    and this project will no longer notify in any rooms.
