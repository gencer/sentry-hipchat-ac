  Hipchat notifications are managed through Hipchat itself.  After you
  added the Sentry integration directly into Hipchat you can add projects
  directly from there to your rooms.
<p>
  This page only shows in which rooms the project shows up.  To add or
  remove them, you need to use the integration configuration page.

  from a descriptor URL” on your room in Hipchat and add the following
  descriptor URL:
